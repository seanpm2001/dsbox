#' Student survey
#'
#' During the first week of class in Spring 2015, students in an introductory
#' statistics course at Duke University came up with survey questions designed
#' to collect data on variables they are interested in working with throughout
#' the semester. Students answered these questions anonymously in an online
#' survey, and the resulting data are distributed here. Note that these data
#' are somewhat cleaned and potentially identifiable cases are removed.
